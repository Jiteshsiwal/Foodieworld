<h5>Saucy pasta</h5>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiteshsiwal/Foodie-world/main/Images/Saucy%20Pasta.jpg">
<p>Recipe</p><br>
<p>step 1: You can add your choice of veggies in the pasta. Usually, the veggies which I add are carrots, capsicum, french beans, green peas (matar), cauliflower or cabbage.<br>
step 2: However this recipe can also be made without any veggies. But I would suggest adding the veggies as it makes the dish more wholesome and nutritious. Few more pasta recipes where you can add mix vegetables to make the dish more healthy are One pot pasta, Pasta alfredo and White sauce pasta.<br>
step 3: I have used whole wheat penne pasta. You can also use macaroni or other pasta varieties.<br>
Serve the masala pasta hot or warm as a snack or brunch or light dinner. While serving garnish the masala pasta with some coriander leaves or vegetarian parmesan cheese or some grated cheddar cheese.</p>
